# Annual-Bulk-Emailer
Program Summary: If you have a spreadsheet of contacts that you need to send a mass email out to, this program will send out mass emails, and assist you in tracking who has responded.

INSTRUCTIONS:

The first step, which you've already done, is downloading python and this program, then executing the program.

The next step is to copy the section of your working spreadsheet (which is probably on SharePoint) into the program's working spreadsheet (Sheet 2 in the "Spreadsheet" file). Make sure the formatting follows the formatting of Sheet 1, which is just there to be an example.
