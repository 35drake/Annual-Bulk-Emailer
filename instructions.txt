# Annual-Bulk-Emailer
Program Summary: If you have a spreadsheet of contacts that you need to send a mass email out to, this program will send out mass emails, and assist you in tracking who has responded.

INSTRUCTIONS:

The first step, which you've already done, is downloading python.

The second step is downloading the "pandas" library. The program should be able to do this for you automatically.

The third step is to copy the section of your working spreadsheet (which is probably on SharePoint) into the program's working spreadsheet (Sheet 2 in the "Spreadsheet" file). Make sure the formatting follows the formatting of Sheet 1, which is just there to be an example.

The next step is to confirm that the settings are correct. You can see an option for this on the main menu.

Now, you can run the Email Tool to send emails out to people who haven't sent you their documents yet.

What you can also do is run the Inventory Tool to check off those who HAVE already sent you documents (which beforehand you must compile into the "received" folder).
