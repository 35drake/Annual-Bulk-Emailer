Hello,

I hope this email finds you well. I work in the Environmental Health and Safety Department at the Hospital. As a part of NFPA and Fire Department requirements, labs and other non-clinical areas are required to run at least one Code Red drill a year with their staff. 

With that being said, I am emailing you as a reminder to send me your completed annual Outpatient Code Red Drill Evaluation form for 2023 by the end of the year, if you have not done so already (please see attached for a blank copy). If you are no longer the correct contact for your unit, or if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.   

Thank you,
Drake
